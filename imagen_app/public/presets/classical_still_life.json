  "userPrompt": "A sumptuous still life arrangement inspired by classical painters, featuring an ornate wooden table draped with a rich, deep blue velvet cloth. Display vibrant, ripe fruits—glimmering apples, plump grapes, and golden pears—interspersed with delicate porcelain vases of blooming peonies and sunflowers. A soft light cascades through a nearby window, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the textures of each object. Include a vintage silver goblet filled with dark red wine, a handwritten letter partially unrolled, and a small, flickering candle, all set against a backdrop of aged stone walls, evoking a timeless, serene atmosphere."
